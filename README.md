# Data Visualisation Portfolio

## How to View


## Introduction
This repository contains my portfolio for **MXB262 Data Visualisation** at QUT.  
It showcases a series of practicals and assessments completed during the semester, applying key principles of data storytelling, exploratory analysis, and effective communication.

## Contents
- **Portfolio.Rmd** — main R Markdown file containing code, analysis, and visualisations.  
- **Portfolio.html** — knitted HTML version for easy viewing.  
- **Data folders** — supporting datasets used throughout the tasks:  
  - `w7/data/` — cattle farm attributes and edgelist data.  
  - `whiskey_data/whiskey_data/` — locations and sales data for the whiskey trade exercise.  
  - `invasive_plant_rasters_2019/` — raster datasets for invasive plant mapping in Minnesota.  
  - `forest_area.csv` — global deforestation dataset.  

## Highlights
- **Storytelling**: Analysis of grocery price trends (egg price surge in the U.S.) using annotated line charts.  
- **Exploratory visualisations**: Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, bubble plots, radar plots, and alluvial diagrams across multiple datasets.  
- **Spatial analysis**: Maps created with `rnaturalearth` and raster data to explore economic classifications, migration, and invasive plant distributions.  
- **Network analysis**: Visualisation of cattle movements and migration flows using `igraph` and alluvial plots.  

## Purpose
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
- Apply design principles and audience-focused storytelling in data communication.  
- Work with diverse data formats, from tabular CSVs to spatial raster layers.  
- Implement reproducible workflows in R using `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and specialised packages (`igraph`, `ggalluvial`, `raster`, `sf`).
